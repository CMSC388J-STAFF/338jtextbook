This course is an introduction to building secure, full-stack web applications with Python and Flask. We'll start with Python and Flask and transition to web application security, where we'll look at different types of security vulnerabilities and best practices to patch up these vulnerabilities in your own apps. Then, we'll go to building your own API and securely authenticating with it, and finish by showing you how you can deploy your web app!

This Fall, will be hosting all of the lecture content for CMSC388J on this "textbook", rather than in traditional slides. The goals of using this format are to:

- Familiarize students with navigating and using documentation
- Make implementation details easy to find while doing projects

To navigate...
