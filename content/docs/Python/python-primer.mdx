Python is a dynamically-typed, interpreted, object-oriented programming (OOP) language. It's known for being powerful but syntactically similar to pseudocode.


## Beginning Concepts

Python is whitespace delimited—use spaces or tabs, but not both.  
Modern text editors can replace tabs with spaces. If you have an extra space at the start of any line in your code, it won’t run.

```python tab="Python"
for num in range(10):
    print(num)
```

This prints numbers 0–9 in the console.  
This code consists of:
- A `for-in` loop
- The `range()` and `print()` built-in functions
- The integer `10`

<Callout type="warn">Be careful mixing spaces and tabs—this will cause errors.</Callout>


## Syntax

Python's syntax is much lighter than other common object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. In Java, curly braces are used to create and separate blocks of code. In Python, however, whitespace/indentation is used to create blocks:

```python tab="Python"
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

```java tab="Java"
for (int i=0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

This is both a blessing and a curse. This makes Python code quicker to write and more concise, but inconsistent indentation will cause syntax errors. Be mindful of unintended blocks appearing in your code.

<Callout type="warn">Be sure not to mix tabs and spaces as this will confuse the Python interpreter.</Callout>

Also, notice that there are no semicolons required to differentiate lines!

## Typing

Python being "dynamically-typed" means that a variable's type is decided at runtime. That means we can create variables without explicitly telling Python what its type is:

```python tab="Python"
number = 10
```

```java tab="Java"
int number = 10;
```

Python developers operate on the "duck typing" principle: 

<Callout>If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.</Callout>

This means we care about an object having the functions and properties that we require, and not much about its class. As such, Python programs often don't involve type checking.


## EAFP vs. LBYP

Python coding style often follows **Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission (EAFP)** rather than **Look Before You Leap (LBYP)**.

```python tab="LBYP"
if "key" in dict_:
    value += dict_["key"]
```

```python tab="EAFP (preferred)"
try:
    value += dict_["key"]
except KeyError:
    pass
```

Both EAFP and LBYP have their place, but duck typing is central to Python and many dynamic languages (Ruby, Perl, PHP).

## Operators

Boolean operators do not use symbols but rather their English names.

```python tab="Python"
a and b or c and not (d or e)
```

```java tab="Java"
a && b || c && !(d || e)
```

Comparison operators (==, >=, etc.) are the same as in Java and C. 

Interval comparisons can be used:

```python tab="Python"
if 1 <= number <= 5:
```

```java tab="Java"
if (1<= number && number <= 5)
```

## Raising Exceptions 

Since Python is dynamically-typed, we need more runtime error-checking. 

For example, if you want a list of numbers that are between 0 and 10 passed in, you can check for this and raise an exception if needed
<Callout> 
Note: In this case, we don’t care what type of collection data is; 
we just need to be able to iterate over it to check each value
Use the raise keyword to raise an exception 
</Callout>




## Python Classes

```java tab="Java"
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String greet() {
        return "Hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person("Alice", 20);
        System.out.println(p.greet());
    }
}
```

```python tab="Python"
class Person:
    # constructors always uses '__init__'
    def __init__(self, name, age): 
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # 
    def greet(self): 
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old."


# Create an object
p = Person("Alice", 20)
print(p.greet())  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 20 years old.
```




## Imports

Import modules or packages with the import keyword
```python
import <package_name> 
```

Assign your own name with the as keyword
```python
import <package_name> as <new_name>
```

Import specific methods, classes, or packages
```python
from <package_name> import <method/class>
```

Gets rid of dot notation: ```package_name.method()``` becomes ```method()```

Import modules:

```python
import math
import math as m
from math import sqrt
```

<Callout>Recall: a package requires an `__init__.py` file in its directory.</Callout>



## Operators

Boolean operators use words instead of symbols.

```python
a and b or c and not (d or e)
```

Comparison operators (`==`, `>=`, etc.) are the same as Java/C.  
Interval comparisons are also allowed:

```python
if 1 <= number <= 5:
```


## Strings

String formatting with `.format()`:

```python
'{} is a {}'.format('Blahaj', 'shark')  
# 'Blahaj is a shark'

'{animal} can fly. {animal} can also swim.'.format(animal='Ducks')
# 'Ducks can fly. Ducks can also swim.'
```

Concatenation requires everything to be strings:

```python
', '.join(['x', 'y']) + ' abcd ' + str(999)  
# 'x, y abcd 999'
```


## Loops

The only valid for-loop format:

```python
for value in lst:
    # do something
```

While-loops:

```python
while condition:
    # do something
```

Do-while loops don’t exist in Python.


## Control Keywords

- `break`: exits a loop  
- `continue`: skips to the next iteration  
- `pass`: placeholder where code is required  

```python
if condition:
    pass
else:
    print("some actual code")
```

A `for` loop can include an `else`, which runs if the loop exits normally (without `break`).


## Sequences

Iterating over lists:

```python
for num in [0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 2]:
    print(num)
```

Lists don’t need to be homogeneous.  
You can also iterate over strings, dicts, tuples, sets, and other iterables.

<Callout>See Python docs for built-in sequences: https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html</Callout>


## Dictionaries

```python
birth_years = {'bach': 1685, 'da vinci': 1452, 'erdos': 1913}

birth_years['jobs'] = 1955
print(birth_years['da vinci'])

for name in birth_years:
    print(name)

for name, year in birth_years.items():
    print(name, year)

print('erdos' in birth_years)          # True
print('scholze' in birth_years)        # False
print(1685 in birth_years.values())    # True
print(1729 in birth_years.values())    # False
```


## Tuples

```python
record = ('Priya', 20, [1, 2, 3])
print(record[0])

record[0] = 'Amy'  # TypeError, tuples are immutable
```

Tuple unpacking:

```python
nums = ((1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,9))
for a, b, c in nums:
    print(f'First: {a}, Second: {b}, Third: {c}')
```

Swapping variables:

```python
a, b = 8, 4
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)  # 4, 8
```


## Sets

```python
visited = {4, 2, 1, 3, 5}
visited.add('cookie')
visited.remove(2)

print(1 in visited)
print(6 not in visited)

s1 = {1, 2, 3}
s2 = {1, 2, 3, 4}

print(s1 <= s2)   # subset check
print(s1 | s2)   # union
print(s1 & s2)   # intersection
```


## Slices

Slices work with lists and strings.

```python
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(l[1:])    # [2,3,4,5]
print(l[:4])    # [1,2,3,4]
print(l[1:4])   # [2,3,4]
print(l[::-1])  # [5,4,3,2,1]

s = "CMSC388J"
print(s[:4])    # CMSC
print(s[4:])    # 388J
print(s[4:7])   # 388
print(s[:3:-1]) # J883
```


## Functions

Defining functions:

```python
def distance(p1, p2) -> float:
    x_dist = (p1[0] - p2[0]) ** 2
    y_dist = (p1[1] - p2[1]) ** 2
    return (x_dist + y_dist) ** 0.5
```

Functions are objects:

```python
def apply(func):
    data = [1, 2, 5, 6, 1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 9, 2]
    return func(data)
```

Returning multiple values:

```python
def animals():
    return 'duck', 'camel'

a = animals()      # ('duck', 'camel')
d, c = animals()   # d='duck', c='camel'
```


## Function Arguments

Python supports positional and keyword arguments.

```python
def print_stuff(x, y, z):
    print(x, y, z)

print_stuff('a', z='b', y='c')  # prints a c b
```

Variable arguments:

```python
def add(*numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

def print_info(**info):
    print('Name:', info['name'])
    print('Major:', info['major'])

print_info(name='Pines', major='Engineering')
```

Default arguments:

```python
def print_something(x=0):
    print(x)

print_something()   # 0
print_something(1)  # 1
```


## Useful Built-in Functions

```python
s = "darth vader"
print(type(s))
print(dir(s))

l = [True, True, True]
print(len(l))  # 3
```

Conversions:

```python
print(str(123))  # "123"
print(int("456"))  # 456
```


Map and filter:

```python
def square(x): return x ** 2
print(list(map(square, range(5))))

def long_string(s): return len(s) >= 8
print(list(filter(long_string, ['fantastic', 'python', 'acrobatic'])))
```

Any/All:

```python
def is_prime(p): ...
print(all(map(is_prime, range(100))))
print(any([False, True, False]))
```

## Lambda Functions

Lambdas are short anonymous functions:

```python
a = lambda x, y: x + y
print(a(1, 2))  # 3

print(list(map(lambda x: x * 2, [1,2,3])))  # [2,4,6]
```


## Raising Exceptions

```python
def process(data):
    if not all(map(lambda x: 0 <= x <= 10, data)):
        raise ValueError("All values must be between 0 and 10")
    # other processing
```


## Handling Exceptions

```python
data = [(1,2,3,4,5), {-1,2,30,4,-5}, range(20)]

for datum in data:
    try:
        process(datum)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Invalid input {datum}: {str(e)}")
    else:
        print("Nothing went wrong")
    finally:
        print("End of try-except block")
```




## Miscellaneous

- Comments start with `#`.  
- Python doesn’t support true multi-line comments, but you can use docstrings (`''' ... '''`).  
- Print multiple values by separating them with commas.

```python
x = 1 # this is a comment
# this is another comment

'''
line 1
line 2
'''

print("Hello", "world")  # prints "Hello world"
```


## Final Notes

We tried to give an overview of the Python language, but we definitely didn’t cover all features available. 
    * Please refer to the standard library docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
    * And to the language reference: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html
    * We’ll go over more interesting features in coming weeks (generators, context managers, file I/O, enums, RNGs, other tools…)
