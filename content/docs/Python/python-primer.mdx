Python is a dynamically-typed, interpreted, object-oriented programming (OOP) language. It's known for being powerful but syntactically similar to pseudocode.

## Syntax

Python's syntax is much lighter than other common object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. In Java, curly braces are used to create and separate blocks of code. In Python, however, whitespace/indentation is used to create blocks:

```python tab="Python"
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

```java tab="Java"
for (int i=0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

This is both a blessing and a curse. This makes Python code quicker to write and more concise, but inconsistent indentation will cause syntax errors. Be mindful of unintended blocks appearing in your code.

Also, notice that there are no semicolons required to differentiate lines!

## Typing

Python being "dynamically-typed" means that a variable's type is decided at runtime. That means we can create variables without explicitly telling Python what its type is:

```python tab="Python"
number = 10
```

```java tab="Java"
int number = 10;
```

Python developers operate on the "duck typing" principle: 

<Callout>If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.</Callout>

This means we care about an object having the functions and properties that we require, and not much about its class. As such, Python programs often don't involve type checking.
