Python is a dynamically-typed, interpreted, object-oriented programming (OOP) language. It's known for being powerful but syntactically similar to pseudocode.

## Syntax

Python's syntax is much lighter than other common object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. In Java, curly braces are used to create and separate blocks of code. In Python, however, whitespace/indentation is used to create blocks:

```python tab="Python"
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

```java tab="Java"
for (int i=0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

This is both a blessing and a curse. This makes Python code quicker to write and more concise, but inconsistent indentation will cause syntax errors. Be mindful of unintended blocks appearing in your code.

<Callout type="warn">Be sure not to mix tabs and spaces as this will confuse the Python interpreter.</Callout>

Also, notice that there are no semicolons required to differentiate lines!

## Typing

Python being "dynamically-typed" means that a variable's type is decided at runtime. That means we can create variables without explicitly telling Python what its type is:

```python tab="Python"
number = 10
```

```java tab="Java"
int number = 10;
```

Python developers operate on the "duck typing" principle: 

<Callout>If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.</Callout>

This means we care about an object having the functions and properties that we require, and not much about its class. As such, Python programs often don't involve type checking.


## Operators

Boolean operators do not use symbols but rather their English names.

```python tab="Python"
a and b or c and not (d or e)
```

```java tab="Java"
a && b || c && !(d || e)
```

Comparison operators (==, >=, etc.) are the same as in Java and C. 

Interval comparisons can be used:

```python tab="Python"
if 1 <= number <= 5:
```

```java tab="Java"
if (1<= number && number <= 5)
```

## Raising Exceptions 

Since Python is dynamically-typed, we need more runtime error-checking. 

For example, if you want a list of numbers that are between 0 and 10 passed in, you can check for this and raise an exception if needed
<Callout> 
Note: In this case, we don’t care what type of collection data is; 
we just need to be able to iterate over it to check each value
Use the raise keyword to raise an exception 
</Callout>




## Imports

Import modules or packages with the import keyword
``` 
import <package_name> 
```

Assign your own name with the as keyword
``` 
import <package_name> as <new_name>
```

Import specific methods, classes, or packages
```
from <package_name> import <method/class>
```

Gets rid of dot notation: ```package_name.method()``` becomes ```method()```


## Final Notes


We tried to give an overview of the Python language, but we definitely didn’t cover all features available. 
    * Please refer to the standard library docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html
    * And to the language reference: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html
    * We’ll go over more interesting features in coming weeks (generators, context managers, file I/O, enums, RNGs, other tools…)
