## Version

We will be using Python 3.12 to grade projects. You are free to use other versions but not using Python 3.12 could lead to inconsistencies between local and autograder outputs.

## Installation

- Windows: [python.org/downloads](python.org/downloads)
- Mac: brew, [pyenv-installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer), or [python.org/downloads](python.org/downloads)
- Linux: your distro's package tools, [pyenv-installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer), or [python.org/downloads](python.org/downloads)

## Development Environment

The instructors use VS Code, and so it is recommended for students to use VS Code. Using the same IDE will make debugging projects more simple. You may also choose to use:

- PyCharm
- Vim/NeoVim
- Emacs

...or really any IDE or text editor built for Python or general use.

## TODO

Add details from "Virtual Environments" and "Getting Started with Python" slides
